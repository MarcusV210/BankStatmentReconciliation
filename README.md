# BankStatmentReconciliation
This repo contains all files related to the BankStatementReconciliation project I created. It helps a business with their statement reconcilation by automating the entire process, eliminating the need to spend valuable employee time or hire an external person to complete the job for the business. 

## Material 
This repo has 5 models with the 5th trial renamed as FinalModel.ipynb and 4 screenshots with the results. 
- 4 models and 1 final model
